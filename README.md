# The repository for Practical Engineering - Advanced Technology



Focused on Advanced Rocketry, RotaryCraft, PneumaticCraft, Immersive Engineering, and Electrical Age, Practical Engineering- Advanced Technology is designed to interweave the tech mods so that you may need something from one or the other to move the the next step in both. ChromatiCraft also makes a large appearance, and RTG worldgen with all ChromatiCraft progression-required biomes makes exploring the Overworld very satisfying. With Electrical Age and OpenComputers for control, and RotaryCraft, Immersive Engineering, and Electrical Age for processing, automation becomes a fun challenge. Advanced Rocketry provides a mid to late, then endgame exploration and automation challenge to reach the ReactorCraft fusion reactor. LogisticsPipes and Applied Energistics complement each other for storage and autocrafting, both of which are a must for the scale of the pack. Methods of easy interdimensional item transport are locked until later in the game, though you can use some creativity to overcome this. Fluids are not locked, because there's nothing that provides that functionality without being easy.

 

This pack focuses heavily on tech progression, if what you're doing right now seems to be a slow or inefficient way to gather resources or produce something, there's likely some tech farther on down the line that will alleviate your problem, and while you could try it right now, it's recommended that you wait until you have access to that technology. This pack is not for those with little knowledge of Electrical Age, PneumaticCraft, or RotaryCraft, as they're used extensively. Read up on them if you can, you'll need it!

 

Ore generation has been overhauled, and focuses on somewhat more realistic generation. Larger, but still common clusters make finding an ore much more satisfying, and caving is one of the better ways to find ore until you get a boring machine or an autominer. The clusters are small and common enough not to impede boring machine ore collection, so have fun with walls of borers! Diamonds are the most changed, spawning how they would in our world, but much more common.

 

Space travel will be required to get into ReactorCraft, but once space travel is attained, many more ways of resource collection open up, alleviating some previous struggles. You'll need specific planets for specific resources once you try for the fusion reactor, so explore! There's a treasure trove of planets, some beautiful, some resource-rich, some both. Dilithium is produced, not mined, making the seemingly large fuel costs offset by the allowance of complete automation. Planets take advantage of the AR system, so if you seemingly can't find a planet, look farther out or check all the planets on the star in the drop-down.
