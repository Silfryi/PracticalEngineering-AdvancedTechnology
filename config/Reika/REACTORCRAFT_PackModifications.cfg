Hydrofluoric Acid is produceable outside of Uranium Processors, and can but used for other things. It, however, cannot be piped into them. This is a stubborn and not worth fixing bug
Carbon Dioxide, Ammonia, Hydrofluoric Acid can all be acquired from Gas Giants, though this is not the only way to acquire them
Gold wire can now be made 1-1 in the Immersive Engineering Metal Press, instead of 3-2
Turbine Generator Housings and Windings now have cheaper ways to make them in the Advanced Rocketry Precision Assembler
Heavy Water can no longer be centrifuged from the overworld, as it does not have high enough quantities. Go to a subsurface ocean planet instead
Indium and Cadmium can no longer be found in the Overworld, look on asteroids or other planets
Toroid Magnet Components now need more durable materials
