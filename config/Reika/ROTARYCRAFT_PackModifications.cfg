// ====================================================================================
Aluminium refining now requires centrifuge, 1000C, and electrolyser, not simply smelting for basic processing
Automated Bedrock Dust collection moved to post-planetary exploration, as only small pockets of bedrock exist in the Overworld and Nether
RotaryCraft Control Circuits, Power Modules, and Ignition Units now have cheaper ways to make them with annealed copper
Lonsdaleite, Anthracite, and Graphite can now be found in deposits on Carbon planets, though the compactor is still needed to make Diamond
Heat Ray Core and Heat Ray Barrel now need CO2, and the core does not need a nether star; the Lens now needs Enlightened Fused Quartz
