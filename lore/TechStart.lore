Having mastered the little they left behind, you come to your first serious achievement: steel. You have engineered production of two different types of steel, though one is somemwhat easier on rare materials, but weaker for the lack of them. Standard carbon steel has few uses, but HSLA steel has many more; many materials you will require later will come after these, and the processing chains for some of them make steel look easy. HSLA Steel opens up automation, and this requisites item transport. For long distance transfer, powered pneumatic systems; for short, at first, conveyor belts. You have some plans to make some simple pipes smarter, though they will require laser etching of some sort. Later there are plans for combined conduits, but they present a serious control and space challenege, as you cannot currently move an object through a space it cannot occupy. Railguns or rockets are possible soloutions to long-distance item transport, requiring more advanced materials unattainable for now, but better for interplanetary transfer. Your designs for later technology require you to develop three main powersystems: rotational, compressed air, and eletricity, and together through mastering them you can use a fourth type; a type of some raw energy reqisite for some other industrial machines. Even later there is transfer for the rotational power though electricity, but it will only happen after some time with the rotational power. Your current tasks lie in aluminium refining, and alloy production of multiple types.
