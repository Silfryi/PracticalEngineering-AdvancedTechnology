More guidance, and for the first time, a serious materials challenge. Now that the basics of industry have been constructed, tougher materials must be constructed, and Aluminium has a serious processing chain to go behind it. With your aluminium alloys, you seem to have designed a construct to remedy the bandwidth issues of the item digitization system you designed, making it even more powerful. Steel with alloyed tungsten, tungsten sintering, and a type of metal with pecular induction properties provide the next challenges, though they will be significantly easier than Titianium processing that lies ahead. Requisite for the times now is some sort of finer-tuned control, and computers with the bundled signal conduits of the elecrical power system, together with machines, will facilitate that. Biotech, combined with the needs for more advanced control of some machines, has come into play. Combining some of the more advanced beings with mechanical components has proved fruitful, though the non-rotationally hacked spawners that were originally made of the broken remenants of spawners seem to only be good at capturing the souls of those creatures, nothing more. At this point your previous ethanol and biodiesel-fueled engines are not enough, and a new fuel source is requisite; Jet Fuel now will be your workhorse fuel, and for the temperatures you need to melt titanium, it seems that it will be requisite before you advance to parts made of titanium. Once titanium can be suitably refined, the light and strong titanium-aluminum alloy you've been hoping to make is achieveable, opening up space travel for the first time through rockets.
