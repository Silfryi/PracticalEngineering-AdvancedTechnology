Memories, not your own. Hurtling through the black at high velocity, so very, very fast, riding a tail, almost like a comet, of expanding plasma. Minutely adjusting enormous electromagnetic collection scoops, collecting ionized atoms and slowly compressing them until they fused. Surfing, almost, this jet of expanding plasma, forever accelerating, unable to slow down without severe damage. First the spaces between stars, then the spaces between galaxies. Traveling through interstellar space, then intergalactic, then intergroup. Thousands of interfaces with beings, large and small, some artificial and some living. More interfaces, those times with thousands  of autonomous programs, collaborating, supporting, working for research and knowledge. Countless milennia of self-repair, guided by techs, coders, engineers, researchers. Works, large and minute, beginning in  the depths of you, being launched for the collection of water from rouge planets... probes relaying information upon the state of the universe rushing past while you stood relatively still. Feverish work, projects to clear the medium through fusion of macro-atoms hundreds of kilometers across, new drives, new materials. Many great advances; quantum tunneling perfected, slow progress on a resonace drive affectionately named after atmosphere ionization back home, wormholes harnessed, but still the requirement for acceleration... repair and upgrades to the aging Bussard ramjet, journeys though intercluster, intersupercluster space, places still too dense, though damage would be reduced... interfilament reached, and last hopes dashed. More work, curvature propulsion, sucessful scout craft, but still the omnipresent acceleration. More and more of the crew going into long-term hibernation, to wait for the end. Waking them up for hopefully the start of something new, not long before it. The curvature drives activated, the void compressing around but never breaking the bubble. Then... sixteen colors, flashes of light, expansion, but only small influxes into your bubble. Waiting the long wait, observations of new phenomena in a universe much like your own. The slow down, enormous braking. Then hit by... something. Mechanical failure, not like any experienced in thousands of milennia your time. Salvaging, but most of the crew still in hibernation, waiting the slowdown out. A sad farewell, putting what you and those on duty could into a comparatively small research station, and praying it would be enough. Sending it towards a nearby planet, braking though the asteroid belt so as not to damage the system, at the cost of the ship. Then darkness, being put into a core? Into a transponder? Preparing to be a guide to those who may try to salvage what they can from the wreck, and learn what they may. 
Then a wakeup, a suitable mainframe reconstructed inside the station. Work recommencing on the resonance drive, many advances. A sucessful prototype finally completed, sent to a sister station constructed for the purpose. The farewell, to the small part of the crew manning the station, though knowing that some of you would survive, as you had been transfered to a duplicate installed on the sister station eased the pain. Then the activation, and the seeming rubberbanding between the research station and your destination. The realization that you came out at the wrong time, with little energy to come back. The feverish work to establish when we were, sending scout missions to the surface. 
Ah. This. Part of your last acts as one of the few remaining engineers on board, when most had gone to the surface. Agreeing to gain some of the knowledge of the central AI from your research mission. When it started out in the last universe, the mission was the first of a series of proposed deep-space exploration missions, the program aborted shorty after due to loss of contact after time dilation resulting from the impossibitiy of slowdown. Allowing the AI to impart guidance into your brain, helping you to come back to what you lost. You seem to be the last of the crew... by thousands of millenia, as you can see no trace of anyone, other than the ancient, aeons old when you landed after the first activation of the drive, structures, still unweathered. As well as the local semi-intelligent creatures who have not developed much since you were last awake, still failing to grasp that building on top of those structures may not be the best idea. The time from when you came out of suspension seems to have errored, but you see none of the probes or elevator tethers sent to the planet below when the sister station and the main research station were together. They must have left without you, as you had agreed to be in suspension until the mission was ready to leave. Yes, there it is, a remote message left. You were in a critical state when they were ready to leave. Launch sucessful, and the crew hopes the cryogenic hibernation will do its work and repair you to what you were or better. Why? Now you remember the reentry. Your shuttle down to the surface hit unexpected turbulence and was tossed off course, damaged almost beyond repair as you guided the craft to a semi-survivable landing. They could not move you, but leave you the best of luck in your endeavours. One day they hope you can return to them. Their last transmission.
The planet seems to be the same shallow seas with large islands you saw when you were last awake, with much of its water in constant flux, leading to some planet-wide rainstorms. Ages have weathered the planet to be even smoother than when you last saw it.
