Creation of a Titanium processing chain, the infrastructure to support it, and now you have the capabilities to enter space for the first time. Though limited to this body and its satellites, your mining rockets can access the asteroid belt; extending your reach into the system and increasing the materials you have access to. To fuel them, you have two different possiblities, the refined kerosene and LOX, and hydrazine. Both will work, though the refined kerosene has other uses and hydrazine needs ammonia. Helium-3 abundant on the moon, and the Iridium in the asteroids of this system affords you the products for distinctive engineering projects, increasing your reach still further. After your discovery of the secrets of teleportation by the strange purple denizens of the outer reaches of a shattered world through your brief foray into biotechnological constructs, the conduits you have had plans for since your start but no way to move objects through have become a reality. Though there is not much the other biological constructs can do, simply not interfacing well with the advanced silicon chips you have constructed for the control of your more complicated processes, these teleporting creatures interface well and can control low-level teleportation almost subconsciously. With the help of the captured data of one that can teleport, you can construct a living, sentient network capable of routing fluids and objects through teleportation, and have many of these conduits in an area. The careful design of your previous systems has made this an easy accomplishment, and you hope to be able to quickly obtain the rare minerals needed for the new sentient teleportation networks and other more mundane technological improvements from the asteroids in your system, as the teleporting creatures have a strange affinity for platinum, and seem to use it as a base for their teleportation abilities. New technology awaits, and you hope that your plans for a fusion drive and some novel high-strength alloys should help to make that a success. Powered by helium-3 and lithium, you will need to go to the moon of this planet before the drive can be manufactured. Iridium, as well, you feel, will play a vital role in your next constructs; in fact, you already have plans for a terraforming machine that should help to make planets habitable. Careful examinations of these other worlds also affords you new hope: they seem to not have the pressure-hardened rock at their bedrock, but just solid bedrock; the bedrock-grinding machine you have designed will therefore be of much greater use there, and it may even be able to have a permanent setup there. Lastly, you have created a way to send items, fluids, and more from point to point without the invervening connection, and it should prove invaulable here. Hoping for advancedments within the realm your fusion drive, some failed experiments that would have left a radioactive drive were dismantled once the heavy hydrogen isotopes you were using started spitting out large amounts of neutrons have lead you to a sustainable fusion reactor for producing power, though the hydrogen isotopes needed is only found where water ice in great quantities is. Though you would prefer a type of fusion similar to the one in your fusion drive for your power production reactors, the technical challenges are currently insurmountable enough for you to not be able to achive aneutronic fusion.
